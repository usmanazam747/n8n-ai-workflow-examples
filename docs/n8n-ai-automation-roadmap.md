# n8n AI Automation Learning Roadmap

## 1. Fundamentals
- Understand workflow automation concepts
- Learn n8n basics: nodes, triggers, credentials, workflow editor
- Explore n8n documentation and community resources

## 2. Data Integration
- Practice connecting APIs (HTTP Request node)
- Import/export data (CSV, JSON)
- Work with databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

## 3. AI Integration
- Use n8n AI nodes (OpenAI, NLP, image recognition)
- Automate data enrichment, classification, and prediction
- Integrate third-party AI APIs

## 4. Real-World Scenarios
- Centralize data from multiple sources (e.g., real estate, retail)
- Automate notifications (Slack, email, Discord)
- Build data pipelines for analytics and reporting

## 5. Advanced Automation
- Error handling and workflow monitoring
- Conditional logic and branching
- Scheduling and triggers (cron, webhook)
- Security and credential management

## 6. Project Development
- Design and document your workflow use-case
- Export/import workflows for sharing and reuse
- Collaborate using Git and version control

# Best Applications for n8n AI Automation

- **Lead generation and CRM automation**
- **Customer support ticket routing and enrichment**
- **Social media monitoring and sentiment analysis**
- **Automated reporting and dashboard updates**
- **E-commerce order processing and inventory sync**
- **Document processing and OCR workflows**
- **IoT device data aggregation and alerting**
- **Marketing campaign automation**
- **Financial data aggregation and fraud detection**
- **Healthcare data centralization and patient notifications**

## Additional Financial & Healthcare Applications

- **Automated trading bots (e.g., buy/sell triggers based on technical indicators like EMA, RSI, etc.)**
- **Portfolio rebalancing and risk alerts**
- **Real-time market data aggregation and analysis**
- **Medicine expiry monitoring and alerting for pharmacies or hospitals**
- **Inventory management for medical supplies**

---

Medicine expiry check workflows are not widely available as public n8n examples, but can be built using n8n's database, date comparison, and notification nodes. Trading bot templates for crypto and stocks exist in the n8n community, but custom logic (like EMA triggers) usually requires adaptation.
